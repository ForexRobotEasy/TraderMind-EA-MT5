## Expert Start Function
The expert advisor starts executing in the `OnTick()` function. It checks if the current symbol is USDCAD and the timeframe is H1. It then proceeds to calculate the current market situation using a neural network model implemented in the `CalculateMarketSituation()` function.

Based on the market situation, the expert advisor calculates the dynamic trading parameters including stop loss, take profit, and trailing stop using the `CalculateStopLoss()`, `CalculateTakeProfit()`, and `CalculateTrailingStop()` functions respectively.

It then places a buy or sell order based on the market situation. If the market situation is positive, a buy order is placed using the `OrderSend()` function with the specified lot size, stop loss, take profit, and magic number. If the market situation is negative, a sell order is placed.

Finally, the expert advisor modifies the stop loss and take profit levels based on the trailing stop using the `ModifyStopLossTakeProfit()` function.

## Calculate Market Situation
The `CalculateMarketSituation()` function is responsible for implementing the neural network model to calculate the market situation. It returns a value between -1 to 1 representing the market situation.

## Calculate Stop Loss
The `CalculateStopLoss()` function calculates the stop loss based on the market situation. It uses the Bid price and the specified stop loss in pips to determine the stop loss level.

## Calculate Take Profit
The `CalculateTakeProfit()` function calculates the take profit based on the market situation. It uses the Bid price and the specified take profit in pips to determine the take profit level.

## Calculate Trailing Stop
The `CalculateTrailingStop()` function calculates the trailing stop based on the market situation. It uses the specified trailing stop in pips to determine the trailing stop level.

## Modify Stop Loss and Take Profit
The `ModifyStopLossTakeProfit()` function is responsible for modifying the stop loss and take profit levels for the open orders. It iterates through all the open orders and checks if the order symbol and magic number match. If the order type is buy, it calculates a new stop loss level based on the trailing stop and modifies the order using the `OrderModify()` function. If the order type is sell, it calculates a new stop loss level and modifies the order accordingly.
